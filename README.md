# About
MultiTokenFaucet is a contract which holds multiple [TokenFaucets](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token-faucet/TokenFaucet.sol). This contract allows the allocation/rewarding of multiple tokens vs. a measure token, such as the PoolTogether Ticket. The `beforeTokenMint` and `beforeTokenTransfer` token hooks are called for each associated TokenFaucet.
